I made a simple game using python.
But I think this game still need more additional functions.
You need to use spacebar to make the stick crash the ball.
Ball will be divided to two smaller balls.
You need to repeat this until all of the balls disappear.
You can move the character by using up, down, left, right button on your keyboard.
